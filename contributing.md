# Contribution Guidelines

This guide is for Mode Tech-Cooperators. We appreciate your efforts in enhancing the Mode ecosystem. This repository is the place where all tech cooperators will share their contributions and work together. This document explains the correct way of contributing to the program.

Here's a high level overview of the contribution process:

- Pick an issue you want to solve from the [Issues tab](https://github.com/mode-network/mode-cooperators/issues)
- Fork the repository
- Create a branch for the task on your forked repository
- Work on the issue
- Sync the forked repo with the main branch of the base repo. Follow this guide: [How to sync a forked repo?](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)
- Create a pull request (PR) to merge your branch into main and please tag 
- We review your PR
- Approve or request for changes

## How to Pick a Task
Before you start working on any task please make sure that the task has been assigned to you, this helps others understand what is being worked on so they don't pick it up again. You can start working before being assigned but just know that until you are assigned to that task, it's not officially yours.

- Check out the [Issues tab]([https://github.com/mode-network/mode-cooperators/issues](https://github.com/mode-network/mode-cooperators/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AApproved)) for a list of approved issues. Note that there is a filter to check for "Approved" tags.
- Comment on the issue you'd like to work on and tag either @joshuanwankwo or @fede2442.
  - "I would like to work on this issue @joshuanwankwo @fede2442"
- One of us will assign the task to you and change the status of the task to "In Progress".
- Have a unique idea you want to propose? Go ahead and open a new issue and request for review from @joshuanwankwo and @fede2442

## How to work on a task
Before you start working on the task assigned to you, please make sure you do the following:

- Fork the [Cooperators repo](link).
- In the forked repo, create a branch and give the branch a name that suits the task and that is descriptive.
- Work on your task and when you are done, raise a PR.

## How to Submit a contribution (or PR)
When you're done with your task and ready to submit, fill out the PR template, which includes:

- Content name
- Content type
- Content link
- Brief description of the task you just did
- Please make sure to sync your branch with the base repo before raising a PR
- Also please make sure you're comparing your new branch with the main branch in the base repo
- After you raise a PR, please go to the issue of the task you just worked on and comment that your PR is ready for review, tag the pull request you just raised for that task in the comment section and then tag @joshuanwankwo and @fede2442
  - "I have completed the task and it's ready for your review @joshuanwankwo @fede2442"

## Approval Process
We want to keep quality high so here's how approval works:

- We'll check your content, perhaps ask for changes, and aim to get back to you within 3 days.
- Once your contribution gets the thumbs up, it's merged. If your PR was merged, it means we accepted your contribution as quality work!


Thanks for making Mode even better!
